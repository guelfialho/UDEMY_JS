JAVASCRIPT IS A HIGH-LEVEL, OBJECT-ORIENTED, MULTI-PARADIGM PROGRAMING LANGUAGE. 


HIGH-LEVEL -> MEANS THAT WE DON'T NEED TO CODE IN MACHINE LANGUAGE ( O AND 1)

GARBAGE-COLLECTED - > AS JS DOES A LOT OF THING AUTOMATICALLY WE DON'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT DELETE THINGS FROM THE COMPUTER MEMORY, IT DOES BY IT SELF.

INTERPRETED OR JUST-IN-TIME COMPILED - > EVERY PROGRAMING LANGUAGE NEEDS TO BE TRANSLATED TO MACHINE CODE (O AND 1). THAT CAN HAPPENS FROM INTERPRETATION OR COMPILATION.

PROTOTYPE-BASED OBJECT-ORIENTED -> ALMOST EVERYTHING IN JS IS OBJECTS (EXCEPT PRIMITIVES SUCH AS STRING, BOOLEANS , NUMBERS AND SO ON AND SO FORTH.

FIRST-CLASS FUNCTIONS -> THAT MEANS: FUNCTIONS CAN BE USE AS ARGUMENTS BECAUSE THEY RETRUN A VALUE. 

DYNAMIC -> THE TYPE OS VARIABLES DOESN'T NEED TO BE INFORMED BECAUSE OF THE DYNAMIC ATRIBUTION AND THEY CAN BE CHANGE DYNAMICLY ALSO. EX: X = 'MIGUEL' LATER ON THE CODE I CAN SET THE VALUE OF THE 'X' TO A NUMBER: X = 18. AND EVERYTHING WORKS JUST FINE. THIS MAY PRODUCE SOME BUGS, AND IF WE WANT WE CAN USE TYPESCRIPT TO TRANSFORME JS IN A STRONG TYPE LANGUAGE.

SIINGLE-THREADED -> MEANS THAT JS CAN ONLY HANDLE ONE THING AT TIME. AND FOR BE ABLE TO HANDLE MULTI-TASKS SIMULTANEALY WE HAVE DE EVENT LOOP THAT RUNS LONG TIME TASKS IN 'BACKDOORS' AND ONCE IT IS FINISHED, THEY RETRUN TO THE PRINCIPAL THRED.
